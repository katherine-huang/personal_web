Hi! I am Xiaoshan Huang. I was born in [Shenzhen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen), China. 
I have a background of Educational Psychology, and I am currently a Ph.D. student in Learning Sciences at McGill University in [Quebec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec), Canada. 
I work with [Dr. Susanne Lajoie](https://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/chairholders-titulaires/profile-eng.aspx?profileId=2821) (Canada Research Chair, Tier 1). 

My research focuses on learners' cognitive and affective experience in technology-rich contexts. I am also interested in teachers' mental well-beings and coping strategies in the online contexts. 
I am currently investigating learners' social-emotional interactions and emotion regulation in computer-supported collaborative learning. 
I am committed to using advanced technologies to benefit learners' social emotional interactions and aid collaborators' decision-making in problem-solving tasks.
