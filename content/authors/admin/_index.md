<span style="color: orange">I am moving to the Bay area this year as a visiting student at Stanford University, working with [Nick Haber](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/nhaber). Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaborating!</span>

Hi there! I am Xiaoshan Huang.  I have a background of Educational Psychology, and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Learning Sciences at McGill University in [Quebec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec), Canada. 
I work with [Dr. Susanne Lajoie (Canada Research Chair, Tier 1)](https://www.mcgill.ca/atlas-lab/principal-investigator). 
I was born in [Shenzhen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen), China. 

My research focuses on learners' cognitive and affective experience in technology-rich contexts. I am also interested in teachers' mental well-beings and coping strategies in the online contexts. 
I am currently investigating learners' social-emotional interactions and emotion regulation in computer-supported collaborative learning. 
I am committed to using advanced technologies to benefit learners' social emotional interactions and aid collaborators' decision-making in problem-solving tasks.
