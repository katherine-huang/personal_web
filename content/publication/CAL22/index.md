abstract: Self-regulated learning (SRL) and medical reasoning skills are both crucial for diagnosing patients. Medical students can practice clinical reasoning with computer simulations. Students solved virtual patients of varying complexity in an intelligent tutoring system. We examined the co-occurrences of SRL behaviors and medical reasoning process. Epistemic network analysis was used to analyze the interplay of SRL and medical reasoning. High performers show more co-occurrences of reflection and higher-order reasoning. Task complexity has impact on students’ learning and reasoning co-occurrences. Intelligent tutoring systems should foster regulation and reasoning acquisition.    

   

 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The epistemic network analysis can detect learning and reasoning co-occurrences. High performers show more co-occurrences in reflection and higher-order reasoning. Task complexity has impact on students’ learning and reasoning co-occurrences. Intelligent tutoring systems should foster regulation and reasoning acquisition.
